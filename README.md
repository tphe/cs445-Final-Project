# cs445-Final-Project
Final project for cs445 - Gradient sketching

This Python script is intended to take a still image and create a gif of the image being "sketched" as if an artist were drawing it. This is the final project for Tom Phelan and Will Wang for CS445 - Computational Photography, Spring 2020 semester.
